The process of communication is defined by marketing researchers as below:
A receiver, upon receiving a message from a sender over a channel, interacts with the message,
thereby generating effects (user behavior). Any message is created to serve an end goal. For a
marketer, the eventual goal is to get the desired effect (user behavior) i.e. such as likes,
comments, shares and purchases, etc.

In this challenge, you will try to solve the problem of behavior simulation (Task-1) and content
simulation (Task-2), thereby helping marketers to estimate user engagement on their social
media content as well as create content that elicits the desired key performance indicators (KPI)
from the audience.
(You can read these papers [1,2] to understand both the tasks a bit better)
